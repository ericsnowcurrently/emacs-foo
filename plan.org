* evil mode as a backbone

Let's define some states:
- insert
- movement
- edit
That's all as far as I know it. Later vi-like modes like visual are
to be considered.

For all states that allows to type (emacs, insert), the mode
switching should be C-{key from right side of the keyboard}. What
keys do we have to bind?

1. Switching to emacs state should be available in every state. So,
   write the macro that traverses all states and sets C-z keybinding to
   this mode. First, set foo-all-states variable:

   (set foo-all-states
    ('evil-insert-state
     'evil-normal-mode
     'evil-movement-mode))

2. 

How the Emacs should start? Let's define init.el. init.el should just
include stuff and be commented with statements from this plan.

Now, let's create directory for every mode.
